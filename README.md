# 2096, The Opening

The world, the place humans used to call home.
earth has turned into a warzone, anywere you travel.
humans forced to hide, without anywhere to go or trust.
AI was going to be great they said, but now it has controll over our entire world.
and its not getting any better with the new life form that has joined the AI.

You,
  A military robot from 2044, made to kill, must walk what not many call earth.
