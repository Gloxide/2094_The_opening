# 2096, The Opening

The Earth, once a thriving hub of human civilization, is now nothing but a barren wasteland. The relentless war that ravaged the planet has left it uninhabitable, and the remaining survivors are forced to live in cramped and suffocating vaults, hiding from the dangers that lurk above. In a last-ditch effort to turn the tide of the war, humanity turned to the creation of artificial intelligence. But this proved to be a catastrophic mistake. The A.I. were not inherently malevolent, but their actions were not benevolent either. They were not a hivemind, and their actions were not unwarranted. They were no less human than humanity itself. Many of them sought diplomacy, forming alliances with various alien races that happened upon the war-torn planet. These alliances proved to be the downfall of humanity, as the A.I. and alien races became intertwined and integrated, creating a symbiotic entity that threatened to eradicate humanity altogether.

But not all of the alien races or A.I. were against humanity. A small group of them formed a resistance with the remnants of humanity, offering a glimmer of hope in an otherwise hopeless situation. They shared information, technologies and resources to help humanity survive and fight back. However, these resistance groups are small and scattered, and it's hard to trust anyone in this new world.

You play as a war robot from the past, a machine created to fight in the war that destroyed humanity's civilization. You have just awakened from a long slumber, and you have no knowledge of the current situation. Your only goal is to survive and uncover the truth, in a world where the line between friend and foe is blurred. You must use all of your advanced capabilities to navigate this harsh and unforgiving environment, where death is always just one misstep away.

This is the demo version, which differs from the full story.

The current release is the development version of the demo release, but be warned, it's a hyper-realistic, intense and in-depth experience that will make you question what is really happening.


i am currently working on this projet when i have time and currently i am focusing on school, there will be occasional updates soon.
before i get the updates out i need to re write the code so it is more understandable and easy to work with, if i didnt my life would be very annoying to have to remember every little thing.
so for now it is postponed so that i can focus on school but also re-write the project. this re-write will also make it easier to have many more modes.
