# 2096, The Opening

The Earth, a place once called home by the human race is now what seems to be their grave.
War has torn the Earth apart, with little to no salvation or escape anywhere.
Mankind and it's allies were forced to hide in cramped dark vaults, as any unfortunate souls left on the surface slowly dwindled.
Humanity tried to play god, making artificial intelligence a reality to great success.
How hopeful they were, dreaming of all the great feats A.I. could accomplish.
Little did they know among those great feats would be eventually be toppling the human race.
The A.I. wasn't malicious. They were no hivemind. This wasn't unwarranted. They were no less human than humanity itself.
Many of them showed diplomacy, making amends to be on good terms with an alien race who had happened in during the war.
The A.I. and the alien race had formed a close alliance, being intertwined and integrated into eachother as one entity.
However, small groups of this alien race and the A.I. sympathized with the humans, forming a resistance with humanity.
With this, hope still gleamed. Perhaps they would survive.


You take the role of a war robot from long ago, when steel and flesh were friend and not foe.
Having only just woke up in this situation after decades of being broken, you have no idea what is going on.
Your only goal now is to survive and find out what the fuck is happening.

*This is the demo version, witch is different from the full story*

The current release is the development of the demo release

i am currently working on this projet when i have time and currently i am focusing on school, there will be occasional updates soon.
before i get the updates out i need to re write the code so it is more understandable and easy to work with, if i didnt my life would be very annoying to have to remember every little thing.
so for now it is postponed so that i can focus on school but also re-write the project. this re-write will also make it easier to have many more modes.
